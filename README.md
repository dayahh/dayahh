### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**dayahh/dayahh** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->
This is what I've been getting up to lately:

- :eyes: **Iâ€™m currently working on** two video game projects!
-  ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning about** game development through AR (augmented reality) and VR (virtual reality) technology. Thank you Gameheads.
- :video_game: **My latest completed project** is a 2D snack stealth game called Late Night Snackin'. Check out the demo on Gameheads' <a href="https://gameheads.itch.io/late-night-snackin" target="_blank">itch.io page</a>.
- ðŸ¤” **Iâ€™m looking for help with** creating marker-based AR applications
- :signal_strength: **Feel free to connect with me** on LinkedIn, link information is in the bio.
- âš¡ **Fun fact:** The character in my profile pic is a Marvel superhero named Lunella Lafayette aka Moon Girl. In the Marvel comics, she is currently the smartest person in the world. As a black girl, and an inhuman (super human beings), she faces many kinds of difficulties because of who she is. But she inspires me because Lunella spends a lot of her time in the STEM and tech fields, using her great knowledge to build her own superhero gear and overcome many of earth's greatest disasters with her quick thinking.
